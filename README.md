### Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my profile on GitHub!

Graduated with a Bachelor of Physics from the Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI) in 2021 and completed a postgraduate degree in Data Science and Big Data from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas) in 2022.  I am currently a Data Scientist at ZENVIA, where I work with machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.  My experience in Data Science encompasses machine learning applications, big data analysis, cloud applications, computer vision, and the application of neural networks in astronomy.  I am also currently pursuing a Master's degree in Astrophysics with a focus on Data Science.
